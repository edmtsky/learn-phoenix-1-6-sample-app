## main topic:

  The creation of static pages using raw HTML files,
  with a small amount of dynamic content.


## learned things:

- the full procedure of creating a new Phoenix web application from scratch,
  installing the necessary packages.

- routes are defined in the file `lib/APP_NAME_web/router.ex`.

- Phoenix templates can contain static HTML or embedded Elixir (HEEx).

- Automated testing allows us to write test suites that
  drive the development of new features, allow for confident refactoring, and
  catch regressions.

- Test-driven development uses a "Red, Green, Refactor" cycle.

- Phoenix layouts allow the use of a common template for pages in our application,
  thereby eliminating duplication.
