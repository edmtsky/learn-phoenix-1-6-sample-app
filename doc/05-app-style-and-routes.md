## main goal
- layout - add a decent style to a web application
- routes - clickable links for pages (home, help, about, contact, signup)


## learned things:

- Using HTML5, we can define a site layout with
  logo, header, footer, and main body content.

- Phoenix partials are used to place markup in a separate file
  for convenience and maintainability.

- CSS allows you to style the site layout based on CSS classes and ids.

- The Bootstrap framework makes it easy to make a nicely designed site quickly.

- Sass and esbuild allow us to eliminate duplication in our CSS
  while packaging up the results efficiently for production.

- Phoenix allows us to define custom routing rules,
  thereby providing named routes.

- Integration tests effectively simulate a browser clicking from page to page.
